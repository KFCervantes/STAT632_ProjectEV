```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The purpose of this was to test if the model will work in a pdf document as opposed to a github document.

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\texttt{PriceinUK}}} = & \beta_0\\
+& \beta_1 \texttt{Subtitle} \\
+& \beta_2 \texttt{Subtitle}^2 \\
+& \beta_3 \texttt{TopSpeed}^2 \\
+& \beta_4 \ln \texttt{Efficiency} \\
+& \beta_5 \ln \texttt{NumberofSeats} \\
+& \epsilon
\end{align*}

Fortunately, this seems to have worked.
