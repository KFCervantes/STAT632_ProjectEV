This document is meant to draft out stuff and select variables.

First, variables will need to be selected. In order to do this, a correlation matrix will be used to pick which variables will be kept before doing linear regression.

```{r}
data %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>%
  drop_na %>%
  cor %>%
  kable
```
